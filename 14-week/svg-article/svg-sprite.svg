Just because something is SVG, it doesn’t mean it should go inside your SVG sprite. For instance:

Illustrations that you don’t need to style: consider using the <img> element.

Illustrations that you want to animate: consider inlining the whole <svg> in your page, so you can select and style specific groups or paths or shapes, animate some parts, etc.
As a rule of thumb, if it’s a big illustration that you need to show at 100px by 100px or much bigger, or if it contains dozens of elements, it might not be an “icon”.
